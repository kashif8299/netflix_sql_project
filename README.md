## **Technologies Used**
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Aggregate Functions & Joins

## **Key SQL Queries**
- **Movies released in 2020**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM netflix_titles WHERE type = 'Movie' AND release_year = 2020;
  ```
- **Top 5 years with the most content added**
  ```sql
  SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS total_content FROM netflix_titles
  GROUP BY release_year ORDER BY total_content DESC LIMIT 5;
  ```

## **How to Use the Project**
1. Download the Netflix dataset.
